/**
 * Copy for the Freebuff subscription promotion.
 *
 * TWO CONSUMERS, ONE CATALOG. {@link HOUSE_AD_VARIATIONS} is the creative set
 * the house CAMPAIGN is seeded from (`scripts/seed-house-subscription-campaign.ts`),
 * and {@link HOUSE_AD_CREATIVES} is the checked-in FLOOR -- the last-resort
 * fill when no campaign could serve at all. They are deliberately the same
 * strings: the floor is variation 0 of each surface, so the safety net always
 * reads like the product rather than like something written once and forgotten.
 *
 * THE FLOOR IS COPY, NOT INVENTORY. There is no campaign row, no budget, no
 * frequency cap and no targeting behind it, and that is deliberate: a house
 * fallback that can itself return nothing is not a fallback. It is also off by
 * default and unset in production. The CAMPAIGN is a different thing and is
 * capped: it carries the shared per-user frequency default, the same as any
 * advertiser who configured none. The floor's serving mechanism lives in
 * `@codebuff/internal/ad-serving/house-ad` and is required to be total over
 * every surface below.
 *
 * ONE EXCEPTION, AND IT IS NOT TARGETING: since 2026-09-02 an entitled
 * subscriber is served nothing here. This copy advertises the subscription, so
 * the one reader it must never reach is the one who already bought it. Every
 * serve path -- the campaign's candidate filter and all four checked-in floors
 * -- asks `resolveHouseSuppressedForUser` first. That is the ONLY thing a
 * serve path reads about a subscription; the claims below are unaffected, and
 * in particular a subscription still does not remove ads.
 *
 * **This file is published.** `common` ships wholesale to the public mirror
 * (docs/public-repo-sync.md). That is fine here -- it is marketing copy and a
 * price we print on the pricing page anyway -- but do not reach for anything
 * server-owned when editing it.
 *
 * DEPLOY GOTCHA: a `common/`-only change does NOT redeploy `freebuff-web`
 * (Render treats its `rootDir: freebuff/web` as an auto-deploy path filter).
 * After editing copy here, check BOTH `web` and `freebuff-web` by commit
 * ancestry and trigger the one that skipped. Campaign creative edits are
 * database rows and need no deploy at all -- that is the point of running the
 * promotion as a campaign.
 */

/**
 * Surfaces the house ad must cover.
 *
 * Deliberately declared here rather than imported: `common` cannot depend on

 * surface there breaks the build instead of silently leaving it uncovered.

 * Freebuff web route and the Desktop display route all serve a subscriber
 * exactly what they serve everybody else, and the `waiting_room` surface is
 * the CLI landing screen rather than an admission queue.
 *
 * The first version of this copy claimed both. Do not reintroduce either
 * without a code path that makes it true -- an ad that lies about the product
 * is worse than an empty slot, which is the only thing it is competing with.
 *
 * THE PLAN TOPS THE FREE POOL UP, IT DOES NOT REPLACE IT. `public-api.ts`
 * builds a subscriber's allowance as `plan.limit + freeLimit`, because the
 * free pool burns first and the plan is what is left after it. So the honest
 * unit is "N MORE a day", never "N a day" -- the bare number both understates
 * what is bought and describes it wrongly. That confusion has already produced
 * one shipped bug, where a picker header read 4 beside a ring reading 9.

 * The SPONSOR BREAK copy, keyed by PLACEMENT ID rather than by surface

 *
 * WHY NOT A `HouseAdSurface` KEY. A break is the same `cli_chat` surface as
 * the inline Desktop slot beside it -- `PLACEMENT_FORMATS` explains why the
 * format is a property of the SLOT and not of the surface -- so there is no
 * surface to hang this on. Keying by placement id is also what keeps the FLOOR
 * out of it: {@link HOUSE_AD_CREATIVES} is built from
 * {@link HOUSE_AD_VARIATIONS} alone, so nothing here can ever be served as the
 * checked-in text floor. That is required rather than merely tidy -- COD-453
 * excludes the text-only floor from a break, and a break card built around a
 * hero cannot render a creative that has none.
 *
 * DIFFERENT BUDGET, SAME RULES. The inline budget above (12 / 28) is the
 * terminal renderer's; a break is drawn at display size and its limits are
 * `SPONSOR_BREAK_CREATIVE_LIMITS` (28 / 60 / 18), asserted in the adjacent
 * test against that constant rather than retyped. Everything else is
 * unchanged: the claims are the same claims, the destination is the same
 * `/plans`, and the banned-claims test covers these creatives too.
 *
 * `*marked*` is the ONE accent run the break card draws in the accent colour
 * (`splitMarkedTitle` in `SponsorSpotlight.tsx`). It is plain text everywhere
 * else and counts toward the title limit, which is why it is spent on one
 * word.
 *
 * These rows carry NO `imageUrl`: a break's picture is the HERO, which is
 * uploaded bytes behind `hero_image_public_token` and cannot be a static path
 * (the same reason {@link HOUSE_AD_FAVICON_URL} exists for the logo). The seed
 * script uploads it; see `scripts/seed-house-subscription-campaign.ts`.
