 * A limited-region account is held to a catalog that contains none of the
 * models a plan meters — EXCEPT the earned reward row. Before this, a
 * subscriber there paid and received nothing at all: every plan model failed
 * admission with session_model_mismatch.
 *
 * THE REWARD ROW IS THE ONE CARVE-OUT, and it has to be. Since 2026-08-31 the
 * reward model is GLM 5.3 Flash, which is also a plan model, and a limited-tier
 * user may reach it against a bounty grant with no plan at all
 * (isRewardModelRedeemableAtLimitedTier). The allowlist deliberately says yes
 * there so an unfunded caller lands on `rate_limited` (limit 0) rather than
 * `session_model_mismatch` — the POOL is the gate, not the catalog. The
 * carve-out is therefore asserted here rather than worked around, because if it
 * ever widened past this one id the plan would stop being worth paying for.
 *
 * A plan model can also be an ordinary free row of the limited catalog (Flash
 * is), so the assertions distinguish "free in this tier" from "plan-only".
