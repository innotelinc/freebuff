 * deliver $50 or $3 depending on how many developers actually save the env
 * var, and billing $50 either way is charging for activations we did not
 * deliver. So placements is prepaid — the advertiser tops up, delivery draws
 * the balance down, campaigns stop serving at zero.
 *
 * Nothing here talks to Stripe. These are the values and rules both the
 * advertiser-facing form and the webhook-side parser have to agree on, which
 * is why they live in `common` rather than in either app.
 *
 * See `docs/freebuff-placements-prepaid.md` for the ledger shape and the
