/**
 * Log-scale bucketing for time-to-first-token samples.
 *
 * The /latency dashboard reports p50/p95 TTFT over a 24h window, but percentiles
 * are not additive: you cannot combine hourly p50s into a window p50. Storing a
 * histogram per (hour, model) is what makes the rollup summable — counts add, so
 * percentiles over any set of hours (and over any set of models) come from the
 * merged distribution rather than from the raw `message` table.
 *
 * Buckets are geometric, so the error is a fixed *relative* one at every
 * latency: a bucket spans BASE**i .. BASE**(i+1), and we report its geometric
 * midpoint, so a reported value is within ±1.5% of the true sample. That matters
 * more than absolute precision here — the page renders 1.9s and 3.0s, and models
 * are ranked against each other, so a constant relative error preserves both the
 * displayed figure and the ordering.
 *
 * These constants are baked into stored rows: `message_latency_bucket.bucket` is
 * an index in this scheme. Changing BASE or BUCKET_COUNT silently reinterprets
 * every existing row, so a change means re-rolling the retained window.
