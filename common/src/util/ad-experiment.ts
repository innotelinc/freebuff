/**
 * The sticky arm for one user.
 *
 * `off` IS `control` FOR EVERYONE, and not merely "control by default": the
 * mode is checked BEFORE the hash, so with the knob absent nothing about the
 * assignment can vary. That is the byte-identical-when-off property every ad
 * knob in this repo has.
 *
 * `shadow` still returns a REAL arm -- it is assigned and logged, and whether
 * anything may be routed on it is the caller's decision, not this function's.
 * Folding the mode check into the return value here would mean a shadow week
 * measured nothing.
 *
 * A caller with no user id parks in `control`: every ad surface rejects
 * unauthenticated callers, so this is defensive rather than a supported path.
