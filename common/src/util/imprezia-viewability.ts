/**
 * MRC50 viewability: an ad counts as viewed once at least 50% of its pixels
 * have been continuously visible for one full second while the page is in the
 * foreground.
 *
 * "Continuous" is the whole difficulty. Scrolling the ad half out of view, or
 * backgrounding the tab, restarts the clock from zero rather than pausing it —
 * so this is a small state machine rather than an accumulator.
 *
 * This lives in `common` because two surfaces measure it and their answers are
 * billed against the same publisher account: the web chat renderer and the
 * Desktop renderer (Electron is Chromium, so it has a real viewport, layout
 * and page-visibility state). If the two ever disagreed about what "viewable"
 * means, the advertiser's delivery numbers would depend on which app the user
 * happened to open. The CLI is deliberately NOT a caller — a terminal has no
 * viewport to measure against, so it reports insertion only.
 *
 * `createMrc50Tracker` is kept free of React and of the DOM so the timing
 * rules can be tested directly; `observeMrc50` is the thin DOM binding that
 * feeds it IntersectionObserver ratios and the page visibility state.
