/**
 * How many copies of the *same* exception we are willing to send to PostHog.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS: nothing between "client code throws" and "PostHog bills us"
 * was bounded. Every `logger.error` in the CLI captures an exception
 * (cli/src/utils/logger.ts `logAsErrorIfNeeded`), and posthog-node's
 * `enableExceptionAutocapture` turns every uncaught error and unhandled
 * rejection in the CLI and Desktop into one more, so a client stuck in a retry
 * loop bills one exception per iteration, forever. On 2026-08-26 that produced
 * 1,090,609 exceptions against a ~30k/day baseline — and it was invisible in
 * Axiom, because the log shippers on those surfaces DO drop under load
 * (cli/src/utils/log-shipper.ts keeps 1,000 records and shifts out the oldest).
 *
 * A geometric ladder rather than a rate limit: a rate limit spends its budget
 * on whichever error is loudest, while a ladder keeps the FIRST sighting of
 * every distinct error — the one that says "this is new" — and still collapses
 * a million repeats into seven events. Same shape as the Desktop toast-error
 * budget in freebuff-desktop/src/ui/store.ts. Nothing is hidden: the counts
 * move from rows onto `$exception_occurrence`.
 */

/** Distinct exceptions one process tracks before it stops opening buckets.
 *  Guards the other failure shape: one cause minified into many fingerprints
 *  (a version-skew "x is not a function" produced 74 of them), where the

 * ladder on exactly the long-running loops it is for.
 *
 * Both libraries hand `before_send` a fully built `$exception_list` of

 * an object arrives as "Object captured as exception with keys: …", so
