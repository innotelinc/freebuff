/**
 * Splitting a picker section's quota rows into "the pool this section is about"
 * and "the rows that answer to something stricter".
 *
 * Every client had the same shortcut: one section, one pool, so read any entry
 * and label the whole section from it. The CLI took `Object.values(...)[0]`,
 * Freebuff Web took the first Premium row with a quota. That held until
 * 2026-08-19, when DeepSeek got a one-a-day ceiling ON TOP of the premium pool
 * and two pools started appearing inside one section. The shortcut then reports
 * "1 of 5 used" beside a row that is already spent and greyed out, with nothing
 * saying why.
 *
 * The rule here is deliberately arithmetic rather than semantic: the section
 * header takes the pool that MOST of its rows belong to, and every other row
 * carries its own. No client needs to know that DeepSeek is the odd one, which
 * is the point — the next model to get its own ceiling is a server edit, and
 * installed clients render it on their next poll.
 *
 * Shared so the three pickers cannot drift into three different answers about
 * the same payload.
