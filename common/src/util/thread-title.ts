- Describe what the message is *about*, in general terms. Never copy sensitive personal data into the title — names, emails, phone numbers, addresses, API keys, passwords, or other secrets. Summarize the topic, not the private details.
- If the message is too vague to summarize, use its wording as the title instead of a generic placeholder.

Output only the title.`
