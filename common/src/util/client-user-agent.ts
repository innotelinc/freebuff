/**
 * Normalize an HTTP `User-Agent` into a bounded token for analytics.
 *
 * Which client made a request is otherwise unanswerable server-side. The only
 * client-identifying field we store is `session.fingerprint_id`, which the
 * client picks for itself — reading it as client identity produced a
 * 659-account false-positive ban on 2026-08-03. The request user agent is a
 * second, independent signal: the official CLI sends `Freebuff-CLI/<version>`
 * (`getCliAdRequestUserAgent` in cli/src/hooks/use-gravity-ad.ts), so anything
 * else is at least worth a look.
 *
 * It is **not** proof either: a user agent is equally client-supplied, and
 * published Freebuff proxies already spoof ours. Treat the output as a lead.
 *
 * Two properties make this safe to attach to a high-volume event:
 *
 * - **PII.** Only the leading RFC 7231 product token is kept, so every
 *   parenthetical detail is dropped before anything is recorded:
 *   `Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) AppleWebKit/537.36 …`
 *   becomes `mozilla/5.0`. Nothing after the first whitespace is read.
 * - **Cardinality.** Values are bounded in size and charset: the product is
 *   lowercased and stripped to `[a-z0-9._-]`, and anything empty or longer than
 *   32 chars collapses to the single constant `unrecognized`. A version must
 *   both look like a version and fit in 16 chars or it is omitted. Nothing is
 *   ever truncated into a new value.
 *
 *   This bounds each value, not the number of distinct values: a hostile client
 *   can still vary the product within 32 legal chars. That residual risk is
 *   accepted because an allowlist would defeat the entire point — spotting a
 *   client we have not seen before. It is why this field feeds analysis only,
 *   never enforcement, and why the chat-completions call site rides the
 *   existing 1% free-mode sample. If it is ever abused, the fix is an allowlist
 *   here, not at the call sites.
