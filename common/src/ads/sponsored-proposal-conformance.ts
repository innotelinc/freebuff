/**
 * The sponsored-proposal conformance matrix, as data (COD-376).
 *
 * One numbered check list that Web, Desktop and CLI all report against, so
 * "the terminal card behaves like the web card" is a claim with a shape rather
 * than an impression. A surface's run produces one result per ID — `pass`,
 * `fail`, or `waived: <reason>` — and a surface with any `fail`, or any waiver
 * this file does not list for it, is not conformant.
 *
 * The IDs are the contract and are STABLE. Renumbering them silently
 * invalidates every report already posted on the issue, so a new check is
 * appended at the end of its layer rather than inserted.
 *
 * This is data, not a runner. It exists so two things can be checked
 * mechanically that otherwise depend on someone remembering: that every
 * render-layer ID has a test case referencing it (see
 * `sponsoredProposalConformance.test.ts` beside the Web panel), and that a
 * report's waivers are ones this document actually accepts.
 *
 * The layers, and why they are separate:
 *
 *   VM — the view model in {@link ./sponsored-proposal-view.ts}. Runs ONCE, in
 *        `common`. No surface re-implements these; a surface that did would be
 *        testing its own copy of the state machine rather than the shared one.
 *   R  — render. Per surface, against the shared fixtures in
 *        {@link ./__fixtures__/sponsored-proposal-rows.ts}.
 *   C  — connected. The renderer bound to its transport, with a fake backend.
 *   V  — viewing a run read-only. Only where the surface has such a view.
 *   B  — the gate and billing isolation, against a loopback backend.
 *   E  — end to end, real backend, real user action.

  // THE ARGUMENT THAT CAUGHT THIS, KEPT BECAUSE IT IS STILL THE RULE. An
  // earlier revision of this table reported E-3..E-7 as `pass` for Desktop off
  // `services/sponsored-run.test.ts`, which builds a `fakes()` harness: a fake
  // command runner, a fake proposals client, a fake consent gate. Those tests
  // are good and they pin the logic, but a green fake is the C layer's
  // evidence, not the E layer's — the entire point of E being a separate layer
  // is that the others run against fixtures and this one does not. The CLI
  // block below refuses to report a hand-inserted block as `pass` because that
  // would be "reporting the fixture"; reporting E rows off a fake runner is the
  // same move, and it is harder to notice, because Desktop's fakes are
  // convincing enough that the gap does not announce itself. A row clears here
  // by RUNNING the walk and recording what was observed, never by adding
  // another test.
  //
  // E-3, E-4 and E-7 HAVE NOW BEEN RUN (COD-397, 2026-09-02). A seeded row was
  // accepted on a running Desktop, the consent dialog was drawn, the card
  // walked accepted -> running -> committed with the branch named, the diff
  // appeared in ChangesPanel, and Create pull request opened a real one:
  //
  //   https://github.com/obro79/stormhacks/pull/19  (commit 1b4eb49)
  //
  // `git ls-remote` was empty for the branch before the click and the row
  // reached `landed` with the URL stored server-side, so E-7 is the button's
  // evidence and not the run's.
  //
  // WHAT THAT EVIDENCE IS NOT. One run, on one macOS machine, against a
  // loopback stack, against one repository, on the happy path. It says these
  // three rows are reachable; it does not say they are reliable, and nothing
  // here has been run on Linux or Windows or against production.
  //

  // strings honest: the walk did produce `failed` rows, and the reason did

  // said. An observation collected while trying to make something else work is

 * at all: it is a preference write and a re-seed. So E-4, E-5 and E-7 are

 * there, because a run happens, and E-3, E-4 and E-7 have been observed. E-5 is
 * still waived, but for having never been driven rather than for being out of
 * reach.
 *
 * It is moot for the CLI too since COD-339, and for a different reason again.
 * That surface now has a producer AND execution, so every E row is observable
 * — and none has been observed, because nothing on this branch drove one
 * against a seeded row on a real backend. The whole E block is waived on one
 * honest reason rather than seven different ones, and COD-408 is the harness
