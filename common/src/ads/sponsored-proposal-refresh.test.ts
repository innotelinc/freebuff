/**
 * The proposal card's REFRESH cadence — which state of a row is still owed an
 * answer, and which is finished.
 *
 * NOT in `sponsored-proposal-view.test.ts`, even though the function under test
 * sits beside the view model. That suite is pinned one-to-one against the
 * web/Desktop conformance matrix by
 * `freebuff/web/.../sponsoredProposalConformance.test.ts`, which counts its
 * `test(` cases — so adding cases there breaks a render-parity invariant for a
 * reason that has nothing to do with render parity. Nothing below is about what
 * the two surfaces draw.
 *
 * The bug these exist for: on the COD-397 local walk a sponsored run failed, the
 * row was `failed` server-side for several minutes, and the card went on
 * rendering `offered` with a live "Start sponsored thread" button until the
 * renderer was reloaded. Pressing that button aims an Accept at a proposal that
 * is already dead.
