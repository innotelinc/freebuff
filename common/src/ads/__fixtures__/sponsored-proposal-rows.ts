 * view model already lives here for the same reason
 * ({@link ../sponsored-proposal-view.ts} — "a terminal needs the same state
 * machine and cannot reach into `freebuff/web/src`"), and fixtures that live
 * inside a surface are reachable by exactly one of the three.
 *
 * Values are the ones the existing Web and view-model suites already assert
 * on, lifted verbatim: "Acme Deploys", the one-click-deploys headline, the
 * `11111111-…` logo token. Changing one of them is a change to every surface's
 * expected output, which is the point.

 * would request (Web, Desktop), or stub the response (`ui:shots`). Pointing a
