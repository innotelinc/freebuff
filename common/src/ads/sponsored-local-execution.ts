/**
 * The trust boundary for a sponsored run executing on the USER'S OWN MACHINE.
 *
 * COD-336's decision, as code. `docs/freebuff-sponsored-local-execution.md`
 * "Decision (2026-09-02)" is the prose; this file is the part that is enforced,
 * and the two are meant to be read together.
 *
 * ## Why this is a SEPARATE constant from the Cloud grant
 *
 * `freebuff/web/convex/ads/sponsoredCapabilityPolicy.ts` holds
 * `SPONSORED_V1_GRANT`, which is Cloud's. It stays exactly as it is. This file
 * holds the local grant, and COD-336 acceptance 2 asks for precisely that
 * separation — "one constant per environment, not one shared constant with a
 * comment" — because the two environments differ in a way a comment cannot
 * express: Cloud's blast radius is a disposable Daytona sandbox holding one
 * clone, local's is a developer's laptop, and the local grant is not even
 * constant across operating systems. A shared constant makes the Windows
 * refusal below either reach Cloud (where it is wrong) or fail to reach local
 * (where it is the whole point).
 *
 * ## What actually bounds a local run
 *
 * A capability map bounds the TOOLS. It does not bound a shell. So the grant
 * here is the smaller half of the boundary; the larger half is the process
 * broker in
 * `sdk/src/tools/sponsored-sandbox.ts`, which is what makes `run_commands`
 * grantable at all:
 *
 *   - the floor, every OS: the environment scrubbed to
 *     {@link SPONSORED_LOCAL_ENV_ALLOWLIST}, `HOME`/`USERPROFILE` and `TMPDIR`
 *     redirected into the run's own private directory, `GIT_ASKPASS=echo`,
 *     `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`, and cwd plus every write path bound to the
 *     worktree with symlink resolution;
 *   - macOS and Linux: an OS sandbox under that (`sandbox-exec`, bubblewrap);
 *   - Windows: nothing comparable exists, so `run_commands` is DENIED and the
 *     card says so.
 *
 * {@link sponsoredLocalGrant} is therefore a function of the containment that
 * is actually available, never a bare constant read off the module.

 * and they are separate so that either can move without moving the other. The
 * two refusals Cloud makes are made here for the same reasons, which local
 * execution does not change:
 *
 *  - no `human_in_loop`: a sponsored run is unattended by construction. On
 *    Desktop the thread is never a send target (COD-397 requirement 2), so an
 *    `ask_user` there is a question nobody is shown and the run stalls until
 *    the turn limit rather than pausing.
 *  - no `delegate`: nothing propagates a per-run restriction into a spawned
 *    agent's template, so a gate a subagent does not inherit is a bypass with
