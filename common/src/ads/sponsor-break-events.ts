/**
 * The three client events a SPONSOR BREAK emits (COD-453 scope item 6).
 *
 * A break is the only ad unit on any surface that takes the screen away from
 * the person using it, so the question it has to answer is not "was it seen"
 * -- an interruption is always seen -- but "what did it cost them". That is
 * what `dwell_ms` and the close METHOD are for, and why they are separate
 * events rather than fields on the existing impression ack:
 *
 *  - `ads.break_shown` is the denominator. Without it a low click count and a
 *    break that never rendered are the same row.
 *  - `ads.break_closed` is the cost. `method` says HOW they got out, and the
 *    difference between `continue` (they read it and moved on) and `escape`
 *    (they hit a key to make it go away) is the whole readout.
 *  - `ads.break_clicked` carries `dwell_ms` so an ACCIDENTAL click -- one
 *    landing in the first fraction of a second, on a card that appeared under
 *    a cursor already in motion -- is distinguishable from a considered one.
 *    The parent issue requires those be RECORDED rather than dropped, so the
 *    click route stores the dwell and nothing here filters.
 *
 * CONTINUATION IS DERIVED, NOT EMITTED. Whether the person went back to work
 * is the next user turn within 10 minutes of `break_closed`, computed in APL
 * from turn events that already exist. Emitting a "resumed" event would ask
 * the client to observe something it has no reliable view of.
 *
 * Every event carries the COD-365 hygiene fields from `./ad-event-hygiene`:
 * the client-minted `client_event_id` (one per LOGICAL event, reused on
 * retry), the server-derived `client_family`, and `sample_rate`.

 * - `escape` — a keyboard dismiss. Deliberately NOT pooled with `x`: one is a
 *   considered exit and one is a reflex, and telling them apart is how a
 *   format learns whether it is being read or swatted.
 * - `timer_then_continue` — Intermission only: the countdown finished and THEN
 *   they pressed continue. Distinct from `continue` because the countdown
 *   makes the two mean different things about the dwell that preceded them.
 * - `click` — they left through the ad. The break also emits
 *   `ads.break_clicked`; this method is what stops a click showing up as an
