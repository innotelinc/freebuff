 * policy because there is now more than one environment doing the granting
 * (COD-336). `freebuff/web/convex/ads/sponsoredCapabilityPolicy.ts` re-exports
 * every name below under its historical spelling and keeps the Cloud grant and
 * the Cloud-shaped path/branch checks; `./sponsored-local-execution.ts` holds
 * the LOCAL grant. Two grants over one classification is the point: a tool
 * added upstream has to be classified once, and each environment then answers
 * for itself whether that capability is one it hands out.
 *
 * The classification is TOTAL over `toolNames` (common/src/tools/constants.ts)
 * by contract, asserted by `sponsoredCapabilityPolicy.test.ts`. A tool added
 * upstream and not classified here is a FAILING TEST, not a silent denial — a
 * silent denial is safe but invisible, and what rots is the reviewer's belief
 * that this map was ever read.
 *
 * Deliberately dependency-free: it is imported by a Convex module, by the
 * Desktop orchestrator, and by the SDK.
