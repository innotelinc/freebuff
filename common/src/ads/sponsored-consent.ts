 * The sponsored consent question: one sentence, asked in the same words on every surface.

 * COD-410. The dialog used to be a field list -- advertiser, task, summary, folder, branch, and a
 * paragraph of assurances under it -- and a list nobody reads is not informed consent however much
 * it contains. What is left is the advertiser's name, one sentence of ours, and two buttons.
 *
 * The name is ADVERTISER-AUTHORED and the sentence is OURS, which is why they are never one string:
 * every surface sets the name into its own element (a `<span>` on Desktop, a bold `<span>` in the
 * TUI) with our words outside it, so their text can neither become markup nor be read as a promise
 * the product is making.
 *
 * Desktop's `freebuff-desktop/electron/mcp-consent-bridge.cjs` carries its own copy of these two
 * values rather than importing them: it is a plain CJS module loaded by the Electron main process,
 * deliberately free of workspace requires so it unit-tests under Bun and survives packaging
 * untouched. `consent-window.render.test.ts` pins the copies equal to these, so a change here that
 * is not mirrored there fails rather than ships two different questions.
