/**
 * The scheduled delivery taper.
 *
 * What has to hold: it starts where it was told to start, it ENDS on the
 * target and stays there, it never wanders outside those two numbers, and the
 * randomization is randomization — different day to day, identical on two
 * reads of the same day. That last property is the one with teeth: a jitter
 * that moved within a day would let a caller reroll the day's ceiling by
 * retrying the request until it got a high one.
