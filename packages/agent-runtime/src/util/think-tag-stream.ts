/**
 * Split a model's *content* stream into visible text and reasoning, for the
 * models that put their reasoning in `content` instead of `reasoning_content`.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Reasoning reaches a client on exactly one path: a
 * `reasoning_delta` chunk, which every surface renders in its own thinking
 * box. That chunk is produced only from a provider's native reasoning field
 * (`reasoning_content` / `reasoning` / Responses-API summaries — see
 * openai-compatible-chat-language-model.ts). Nothing downstream ever inspects
 * `content`, so when a lane serves a thinking model WITHOUT populating the
 * native field, the whole chain of thought arrives as ordinary text and is
 * rendered as prose — usually with a bare `</think>` sitting in the middle of
 * it, because the chat template opened the block for the model and only the
 * close is generated. That is the "thinking escapes the thinking box" report.
 *
 * The leak is a property of the LANE, not the model: the DeepSeek direct lane
 * maps `reasoning_content` correctly, while the resold openai-compatible lanes
 * behind the same model id may not. So this cannot be a per-model catalog flag;
 * it has to be recognised from what actually arrives.
 *
 * THREE SHAPES, THREE RULES.
 *
 *  1. `<think>…</think>` — paired tags. Content between them is reasoning.
 *     Unambiguous, free, always on.
 *  2. A bare `<think>` that never closes (a truncated thought). Everything
 *     after it is reasoning.
 *  3. An orphan `</think>` with no open tag — the DeepSeek shape above, where
 *     the open tag was consumed by the chat template's prefill. The text
 *     BEFORE it is reasoning, but by the time the marker arrives that text has
 *     already streamed. Handled by {@link ThinkTagStreamOptions.implicitOpen},
 *     which is armed only once this conversation has PROVEN the lane leaks
 *     (see {@link historyLeaksThinkTags}) and holds the head of the step back
 *     until the marker settles it. When the marker never comes the head is
 *     released as text, so an answer is delayed but never swallowed.
 *
 * With `implicitOpen` off — the default, and every step of every model that
 * does not leak — rule 3 degrades to stripping the marker: the prose before it
 * still renders as prose, but a literal `</think>` never reaches a transcript.
