/**
 * How long to keep reading after the fixture exits. Its diagnostics are written
 * immediately before `process.exit`, so the bytes are already in the pipe and
 * this only covers the hand-off — measured, 100ms was enough to capture them in
 * full. Kept well above that, but deliberately short: the fixture bounds itself
 * at ~21s worst case (15s renderer-ready deadline, then a 6s survival window
 * that starts only once the launcher is killed), and the headroom under the
 * test timeout below is what stops a slow runner from turning a real failure
 * back into the contentless timeout this indirection exists to prevent. A cold
 * Windows CI runner once ate most of a start-anchored budget just booting bun,
 * landing the whole run on the old 15s test timeout with zero diagnostics.
