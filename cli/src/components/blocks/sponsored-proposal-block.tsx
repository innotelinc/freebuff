/**
 * The sponsored proposal card, in a terminal (COD-376).
 *
 * Every string here comes from the shared view model, so this is the SAME state
 * machine the web panel and the desktop card run — a card that reads
 * differently here is a bug rather than a port.
 *
 * ACCEPT EXISTS NOW (COD-339) and runs LOCALLY, in a git worktree on this
 * machine, under the COD-336 boundary. It is not a primary on this surface --
 * at twenty columns there is no room for one -- so it is the first item of the
 * menu and the `/ads:accept-proposal` command, and it is drawn only when this
 * machine can actually contain a run. On Windows the card says why instead
 * (COD-336 item 3: worse product on Windows is the honest trade).
 *
 * Accepting opens the CONSENT panel below rather than starting anything. That
 * panel is the terminal's stand-in for Desktop's main-process dialog, and the
 * reasoning for the substitution is in `utils/sponsored-run.ts` -- it is an
 * adaptation of COD-336 item 4, not a re-opening of it.
 *
 * AND WHILE THE MENU IS CLOSED THERE ARE NO KEY BINDINGS AT ALL. `useKeyboard`
 * is a GLOBAL listener, not a focus-scoped one, so the bare `m`, `esc` and
 * `enter` this card used to claim ran ALONGSIDE the composer's own global
 * handler rather than instead of it: typing the letter `m` into a prompt also
 * opened an ad's menu, and Esc reached the card as a decline while it was
 * cancelling something else entirely. A transcript block cannot own a bare key
 * on a surface whose input is always live.
 *
 * The controls are slash commands instead -- `/ads:proposal` opens this menu,
 * `/ads:dismiss-proposal` declines, and the three standing ones
 * (`/ads:report-proposal`, `/ads:never-advertiser`, `/ads:proposals-off`)
 * already existed. Once the menu IS open the card takes arrows, Enter and Esc,
 * and chat's keyboard is disabled for exactly that span, the same way
 * `askUser` does it -- so those keys reach one handler rather than two.
 *
 * A pull request URL is therefore printed and never opened by a keypress. That
 * is the R-15 waiver read honestly: this surface renders sanitized text the
 * user may copy, not a link and not a primary.
 *
 * Two things a terminal does differently from the other two surfaces, and both
 * are declared waivers rather than omissions:
 *   - the advertiser LOGO is never fetched (R-16/R-17): a token is not rendered
 *     as an image and no request is minted for one, so the advertiser's name is
 *     the whole of the attribution.
 *   - a pull request URL is printed as sanitized TEXT rather than a link
 *     (R-15). The sanitizing still holds: `pullRequestHref` is null for anything
 *     that is not absolute https, and nothing else is ever printed.
