/**
 * The CLI's R layer of the sponsored-proposal conformance matrix (COD-376).
 *
 * Rows come from the SHARED fixtures in `@codebuff/common`, not from literals
 * here: the whole claim being tested is that three surfaces render the same
 * bytes, and a fixture written in this file would be the CLI grading its own
 * homework.
 *
 * Three widths, because a terminal is the only surface whose layout can be
 * taken away from it: 60 is a comfortable pane, 48 a split, and 20 is the floor
 * where the "SPONSORED" marker and the advertiser name must both still survive
 * -- body copy goes first, the headline last.
 *
 * TWO CHECKS ARE WAIVED HERE AND THE WAIVERS ARE ASSERTED, not just declared:
 * R-15 (a link) becomes sanitized text, and R-16/R-17 (a logo) becomes the
 * advertiser's name with no request minted. A waiver nobody tests is a gap
 * nobody notices.
