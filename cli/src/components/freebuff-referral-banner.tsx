/**
 * Advertises the "invite friends" reward on the landing model screen. The

 *   - LIMITED tier: referrals earn a daily free-session bonus (not GLM). One
 *     quiet muted line ("refer friends → more sessions per day") + the inline
 *     copy control, so it advertises the perk without crowding the picker.
 *   - FULL tier, UNLOCKED (you have GLM sessions today): a flashy accent-
 *     bordered card with your remaining sessions and a prominent "Use GLM 5.2 ↵"
 *     launch button, so the reward feels earned and inviting.
 *   - FULL tier, LOCKED (no GLM sessions yet): a single quiet muted line
 *     inviting referrals.
 *
 * Both LOCKED states render on the landing screen under the recommended model
 * card, so their copy control is borderless — the hero card stays the only
 * bordered element there. The UNLOCKED card is a screen of its own making: the
 * reward is earned, so it gets a box and boxed buttons.
 *
 * Every locked-state pitch is sized to fit its tier's card width on ONE line
 * (the banner wraps at `buttonOuterWidth`, not the terminal width) and ends
 * in a colon that hands off to the inline copy control below it. Now that the
 * control is borderless it no longer announces itself as a button, so the
 * colon is what carries the eye down to it. The one exception is the
 * limited-tier at-cap line: referring more earns nothing there, so it ends
 * flat rather than pointing at an action that would not pay off.
 *
 * Renders nothing unless the server attached a `referral` block, so
 * pre-referral-code users never see it.
