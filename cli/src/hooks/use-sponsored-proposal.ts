/**
 * The producer: what actually puts a sponsored proposal in the transcript
 * (COD-339).
 *
 * Before this, `fetchSponsoredProposal` had exactly one occurrence in
 * `cli/src` — its own definition. The card, its tests, its checked-in frames,
 * its transport and its five commands all shipped in Phase 1 and no CLI user
 * could ever see one, which is why the conformance matrix waived E-1, E-2 and
 * E-6 for "no producer" rather than for anything about execution.
 *
 * ## The gates, and why each one is here
 *
 * Modelled on `use-gravity-ad.ts`, because the display rail already answered
 * these questions for this surface and answering them differently would mean
 * two ad rails with two ideas of when a terminal is being used:
 *
 *  - `getAdsEnabled()` — the same switch. A user who turned ads off is not
 *    offered a sponsored task either.
 *  - an auth token — the route is authenticated, and an anonymous poll is a
 *    request that can only 401.
 *  - the first user message — nothing is fetched into an empty transcript.
 *  - ACTIVITY. `isUserActive` is the gate that matters most here: a terminal
 *    left open overnight is not a terminal to poll, and this rail costs a
 *    round trip to freebuff.com rather than a cached rotation.
 *
 * ## Two cadences, and the reason there are two
 *
 * A proposal at `offered` is an OFFER: it changes only when the server rotates
 * it, and once a minute is the right amount of attention to pay that. A row
 * with a RUN behind it is a process mutating the user's own repository, and the
 * card is the only place they can watch it — so it is polled several times a
 * minute, and the shared `sponsoredProposalAwaitsVerdict` decides which of the
 * two applies rather than a second opinion written here.
 *
 * ## The target is resolved once
 *
 * `sponsoredProposalTarget()` memoizes a single `git remote get-url origin` for
 * the life of the process. A folder with no GitHub remote answers null and gets
 * no card at all, forever, with no further git spawned.
