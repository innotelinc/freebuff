/**
 * The producer's two decisions, tested as pure functions (COD-339).
 *
 * The hook itself is a timer and a fetch and is not worth mounting; what is
 * worth pinning is what it DECIDES — how often to ask, and what to do with the
 * answer. Both are exported for exactly that reason.
 *
 * Before this ticket nothing in `cli/src` called `fetchSponsoredProposal` at
 * all, which is why the conformance matrix waived E-1, E-2 and E-6 for "no
 * producer" rather than for anything about execution.
