 * `git grep convex -- cli/` is empty, and a websocket subscription to reach one
 * card is a dependency the terminal would carry on every launch.
 *
 * FREEBUFF.COM, not codebuff.com, which is where the display-ad calls go. The
 * Convex functions live on freebuff.com and the two web apps share one Postgres,
 * so the session token the CLI already holds signs in on either.
 *
 * ACCEPT AND STATE REPORTING ARRIVED WITH COD-396, and they are the two calls
 * here that do NOT swallow their reason. The reads and the channel controls can
 * answer `null` for everything, because the user's response to each failure is
 * the same. Accept is the user pressing a thing and being owed an answer, and a
 * state report is the only writer that can move a locally-executed row off
