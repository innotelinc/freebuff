/**
 * Freebucks, for the CLI — read entirely off the wire.
 *
 * ## Why this file exists at all
 *
 * Web and Desktop import `@codebuff/common/constants/freebuff-freebucks` for
 * the label, the formatter and the price map. **The CLI cannot.** That module
 * is deleted from the public export (`scripts/public-export-manifest.txt`
 * carries `!common/src/constants/freebuff-freebucks.ts`) because it documents
 * measured per-session provider costs, while `cli/` IS exported — so an import
 * of it here builds fine in this repo and fails to resolve in the public one,
 * with nothing in CI to catch it.
 *
 * That constraint turns out to be the right shape anyway. Everything the
 * picker needs is already on the session response: `prices` is a map of model
 * id to price, and the balances come with it. So the CLI derives nothing and
 * hardcodes no number — repricing a model reaches an installed CLI on its next
 * poll, exactly as it does on the other two surfaces.
 *
 * The one thing that cannot come off the wire is the WORD, so it is duplicated
 * below. If the currency is ever renamed, this is the second place to change.

 *   wallet never does).
 * - `allow` — everything else, including every row on an unmetered account.
