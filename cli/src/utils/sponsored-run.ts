/**
 * Accepting a sponsored proposal and running it here, in this terminal, on this
 * machine (COD-339).
 *
 * The whole of the CLI's execution half in one object: consent, the accept, the
 * worktree, the turn, every state report that follows, the interrupt, and the
 * two deliberate user actions afterwards (Create pull request, Remove
 * workspace). One file because it is one decision — "run an advertiser's
 * procedure against the user's repository" — and a decision spread across the
 * commands that happen to trigger it is a decision nobody can review.
 *
 * ## What it does NOT own
 *
 * The trust boundary. That is COD-336's, written down in
 * `docs/freebuff-sponsored-local-execution.md` and enforced in
 * `common/src/ads/sponsored-local-execution.ts` plus the SDK broker. This file
 * CONSUMES it: it asks whether this machine can contain a run, refuses when the
 * answer is no, and hands the SDK a run built from the local grant. It never
 * decides what a run may do.
 *
 * ## Consent, and why a terminal draws it differently
 *
 * COD-336 decision item 4 requires per-run consent drawn by the ELECTRON MAIN
 * PROCESS, for the reason `docs/mcp-desktop/02-security.md` gives about
 * spawning: the orchestrator cannot be the authority for a decision about
 * itself. There is no Electron here and no second process to draw a window
 * from, so the terminal equivalent is an in-TUI confirmation naming the
 * advertiser, what the task will do, the target folder and the branch, which
 * the user can refuse.
 *
 * THAT IS AN ADAPTATION OF THE DECISION, NOT A RE-OPENING OF IT. What item 4
 * actually buys is SUPERVISION — §1 of the doc identifies it as the real delta,
 * and §5 D says a consent gate is "necessary, not sufficient" and must ship
 * beside a mechanism rather than instead of one. Both of those hold here: the
 * mechanism is the same SDK broker Desktop uses, and the gate is a thing the
 * user has to answer before any write happens anywhere. What does NOT transfer
 * is the separate-process property, and it is worth being honest that this is
 * weaker: a compromised CLI could draw a consent screen and ignore the answer.
 * A compromised CLI can also just run the procedure, which is why the property
 * was never load-bearing on a single-process surface.
 *
 * ## The order, and why it is that order
 *
 * consent -> accept -> worktree -> turn.
 *
 * Consent comes FIRST, before any network write, because a Decline has to leave
 * the proposal `offered`. Accepting first and then failing the row back would
 * be two writes to undo a decision the user had not made yet, and any crash
 * between them leaves a row saying a user accepted something they refused.
 *
 * The cost of that order is real and is the same cost Desktop pays: the accept
 * response is the only place the full procedure text exists, so the consent
 * cannot show it. It shows what the card already showed — the advertiser, the
 * headline and the body — plus the folder and the branch, which are the two
 * facts the card does NOT carry and the two that say what is about to happen to
 * this machine.
 *
 * ## Reporting is advisory, except where it is not
 *
 * Every `reportState` failure is swallowed. A run that committed to a branch
 * committed to a branch whether or not freebuff.com heard about it, and a user
 * whose review is blocked on a reporting round-trip is a user punished for our
 * network. The one exception is `landed`, which COD-396 gave a refusal a user
 * can be told about: the pull request exists and the row did not move.
 *
 * ## Billing (Owen, 2026-09-03)
 *
 * The run spends the user's own session and credits, like any other task. The
 * advertiser-pays metering (COD-119) has no server-side reader, so the
 * sponsored marker rides every turn awaiting it and the card says plainly what
 * is being spent. `freebuff_daily_usage` is not written by anything in this
 * file; the turn takes the ordinary path.
