/**
 * Run one of the card's controls, and answer whether it actually landed
 * (COD-376).
 *
 * TWO RULES, and both are about a failure that used to look like a success.
 *
 * PREFERENCE FIRST, THEN THE DISMISS -- and the preference's RESULT decides
 * whether the dismiss happens at all. The ordering was already here; the
 * result was awaited and thrown away, so a failed preference write was
 * followed by a dismiss that succeeded. That produces the exact combination
 * the ordering exists to prevent: the card gone, the refusal never recorded,
 * and the same advertiser back on the next offer -- with the user believing
 * they had said no.
 *
 * FALSE MEANS NOTHING WAS SAVED, and the caller must leave the card live. The
 * caller used to mark the block `answered` in a `finally`, which stands its
 * controls down permanently: a failed control left a card that looked spent,
 * could not be retried, and had saved nothing.
 *
 * A partial (`never-advertiser` whose preference saved but whose dismiss
 * failed) reports FALSE. The preference is the durable half and it is safe to
 * repeat, so the honest answer is "try again" rather than a success the card
 * cannot demonstrate.
