/**
 * The agent a local sponsored run executes as, in the terminal (COD-339).
 *
 * ## The engine pin is satisfied by construction here, and that is worth saying
 *
 * COD-336 decision item 6 pins a sponsored run to the `codebuff` harness,
 * because it is the only harness whose tool loop we own and therefore the only
 * one the capability gate can be ported to. On Desktop that is a real choice —
 * a tab can be set to `claude-code` or `codex`, both of which drive a vendor
 * CLI with `bypassPermissions` / `danger-full-access`, and the pin is what makes
 * those two unreachable for a sponsored run.
 *
 * The CLI has no such choice to make. `git grep 'harness' -- cli/src` finds the
 * `CLI_HARNESS` family switch (base2 vs base3 ROOTS, `docs/freebuff-base3-
 * harness.md`) and nothing that runs a vendor CLI: every turn goes through
 * `CodebuffClient.run` in `utils/codebuff-client.ts`, whose tool loop is the
 * SDK's. So the pin holds trivially — CONFIRMED rather than assumed, which is
 * what the ticket asked for — and there is no engine to override.
 *
 * ## What is NOT trivial: the CLI root offers four tools the grant refuses
 *
 * `createBase3CliRoot` (`agents/base3.ts`) adds `ask_user`,
 * `suggest_followups`, `render_ui` and `skill` to base3's eight. The first
 * three are `human_in_loop` and the fourth is `delegate`, and
 * `SPONSORED_LOCAL_V1_GRANT` refuses both capabilities — a sponsored run is
 * unattended by construction, so an `ask_user` is a question nobody is shown,
 * and nothing propagates a per-run restriction into a spawned agent's template.
 *
 * `overrideTools` cannot close that: three of the four are not client-executed
 * at all, so no client-side handler is ever consulted for them. The narrowing
 * therefore has to happen where Desktop does it — in the `toolNames` of the
 * definition the run is started with.
 *
 * ## Why this keeps the CLI's own root id and model
 *
 * Free mode gates on the (agent id, model) pair (`FREE_MODE_AGENT_MODELS`), so
 * a sponsored run started under an invented id is a run that cannot be admitted
 * at all. The definition is the CLI's own root with a narrower toolset — the
 * same shape Desktop sends — never a different agent.
 *
 * And the system prompt is APPENDED to, never prepended:
 * `hasFreebuffRootSystemPromptOpening` requires the canonical opening at byte 0
 * and 403s every free-mode turn without it (`docs/freebuff-base3-harness.md`).
