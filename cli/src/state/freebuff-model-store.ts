/**
 * Holds the user's currently-selected freebuff model. Initialized from the
 * persisted settings file so freebuff defaults to whatever model the user
 * last picked.
 *
 * `setSelectedModel` is in-memory only — it does NOT persist. Persistence
 * happens exclusively in `startFreebuffSession` (the explicit-pick path), so
 * server-driven auto-flips (`model_locked`, `model_unavailable`, takeover)
 * can update the in-memory selection without overwriting the user's saved
 * preference. The latter previously caused users to get permanently flipped
 * to the fallback model after a single auto-fallback.
 *
 * Components on the landing screen read this to highlight the current row in
 * the model picker; the session hook reads it to decide which model to start.
 *
 * Reasoning effort is the opposite: `setReasoningEffort` DOES persist, because
 * every write to it is an explicit user act (`/reasoning`). There is no
 * server-driven effort flip to protect against — the server clamps rather than
 * telling the client what it chose.
